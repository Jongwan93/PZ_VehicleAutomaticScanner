# Vehicle Automatic Scanner

A Project Zomboid mod that adds a **Vehicle Automatic Scanner**—a mechanics level–based device to quickly check nearby vehicle condition without opening the mechanics overlay.

## Features

### Vehicle Diagnostics
- **Engine status** – Condition percentage (color-coded: green/yellow/red)
- **Fuel level** – Gas tank fill percentage
- **Battery** – Remaining charge percentage
- **Tires** – Individual condition for Front Left, Front Right, Rear Left, Rear Right
- **Locked status** – Indicates if doors or trunk are locked

### Scanner Panel
- Floating info window showing live diagnostics when the scanner is equipped
- Color-coded percentages: **green** (70–100%), **yellow** (40–69%), **red** (1–39%)
- Vehicle type/name display
- Toggle via sidebar button when the scanner is equipped

### Simple Navigation
- When the scanner is equipped (requires **Mechanics level 8**) and you have a **house marker** on the map, automatically shows:
  - Distance to the nearest house marker on the minimap
  - Direction arrow pointing toward the marker

## Requirements

- **Mechanics level 4** – The scanner only works once your character has Mechanics 4
- Project Zomboid (Build 41+)

## How to Use

1. **Obtain the Vehicle Scanner** – Find or spawn the "Vehicle Automatic Scanner" item
2. **Equip the scanner** – Hold it in your hands or attach it to the hotbar/belt (WalkieTalkie slot)
3. **Approach a vehicle** – Stand within **5 tiles** of any vehicle
4. **View diagnostics** – The scanner panel automatically displays engine, fuel, battery, tire status, and lock info
