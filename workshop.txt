description=Simple Navigation
description=When the scanner is equipped and your Mechanics skill is level 8 or higher, the minimap gains a simple navigation aid: if you have any house markers on the map (e.g. your base), the minimap shows a direction arrow at your position pointing toward the nearest house marker, plus the distance in metres (e.g. "House: 120m") in the bottom-left. Helps you find your way back without opening the full map.
